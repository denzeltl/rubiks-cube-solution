                        CFOP (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL, pronounced C-F-O-P or C-fop) is a 3x3 speedsolving method proposed by several cubers around 1981.
                        CFOP has been the most dominant 3x3 speedcubing method since around 2000, with it and its variants used by the vast majority
                        of the top speedcubers.

                            Why Do CFOP Method?
                        </header>
                        <p>
                            The CFOP method average number of moves for a complete solution is ~56 moves. While using the beginner's method, the
                            average number of moves is roughly around 110 moves. (100% more moves!) All top ranking speedcubers today use the CFOP
                            method (sometimes with additional variations to it). Mastering the speedsolving method requires learning some new
                            algorithms and practice, and takes a bit longer than the beginner's method. However since fully mastered it will enable
                            you to speedsolve the Rubik's cube much faster, and basically from there only practice is what stands between you and sub
                            30/20/10 solving time, and the world record!

                                First of all we have to solve the white edge pieces in the bottom. This seems to be the easiest but it's really hard
                                if you want to do it right. You should be able to determine all the rotations needed to complete the white cross after
                                inspecting the cube, and you'll succeed only if you foresee 7 steps.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When the cross is done we solve the first two layers (F2L) in one step using a technique to pair the white corner and
                                second layer edge pieces. We are talking about four corner blocks which usually require 4x7 steps.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Orienting the last layer (OLL) of the Rubik's Cube is the step in which we solve the yellow face without matching the
                                side colours. We are going to position them in the next step. Learn all the 57 algorithms to complete this step

                            The examples below show a couple situations you can meet. The first one is very easy, you just have to turn the edge piece
                            to the correct position. The second shows how to reorient a piece. The third example demonstrates how to place two pieces
                            in one step. The last step shows the steps to fix the Superflip (the "most scrambled Rubik's Cube") in only 6 moves.

                            This first step of solving the white cross is actually an intuitive stage of the solution process. We couldn't even cover
                            every possible situations because at this stage there are so many cases. Almost everyone could get this far without
                            learning algorithms. But you'll need to practice forming the white cross to make it efficient. Do it smoothly, without
                            stopping and with the cross facing downwards. If this works well, you can proceed in our tutorial to the second step: F2L
